**Game Overview: Nightside Vigil**

**Concept**
In *Nightside Vigil*, players assume the role of a leader responsible for guiding a fragile coalition of survivors through a supernatural catastrophe. As a mysterious demon invasion plunges a modern city into chaos, humanity stands at the brink of oblivion, forced into defensive enclaves scattered across a city that blends mysticism with advanced, near-future technology.

**Gameplay Mechanics**

* **Turn-Based Strategy:** Each turn, players strategically allocate resources, manpower, and attention across various tasks and projects. Narrative decisions intertwine, shaping relationships and alliances with diverse factions.
* **Mission Selection:** Every turn ends by selecting one critical mission from an evolving list. Missions have expiration dates—ignoring or failing them has severe consequences, impacting infrastructure, morale, or faction relations.
* **Resource Management:** Starting with limited survivors, players gradually recruit new members, secure advanced technology, and harness mystical insights to expand their influence and capabilities.

**World and Setting**
The setting combines mystical occult influences reminiscent of games like *Persona* with sophisticated yet grounded near-future technology, situated roughly a decade beyond 2025. The demons, enigmatic and unexplained, corrupt humans into "frustrated zombies," rampaging against society and humanity's collective consciousness.

**Factions:**
Players interact with several distinct groups, choosing to support, oppose, or maintain neutrality, impacting the overall narrative and available resources.

**Challenges and Threats**
Periodically, unpredictable demon assaults threaten survival by damaging vital infrastructure, killing population segments, and pressuring the player’s strategic choices.

**Progression and Victory Conditions**
Players must continuously uncover demon vulnerabilities through multiple avenues—science, mysticism, psychic exploration, combat experience—to devise effective countermeasures and secure humanity’s future. The game concludes in defeat if either the player’s headquarters is annihilated or the active population drops below critical levels.

**Narrative and Themes**
*Nightside Vigil* explores resilience, morality, sacrifice, and the ambiguous line between salvation and compromise. It prompts reflection on human psychology under siege and the ethical dilemmas faced when survival comes at the cost of ideological purity or human compassion.
