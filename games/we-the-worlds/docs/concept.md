# Game concept

## High Concept

We, The Worlds is a narrative-driven, open-ended life simulation game set across a vast galaxy of diverse planets and cultures. Players experience the lives of ordinary and extraordinary beings as they navigate the unique challenges, relationships, and societies of different worlds.

The heart of the game is living: making choices, shaping destinies, building relationships, and experiencing the wonders and routines of life, all filtered through the lens of vastly different sci-fi societies.

## Core Pillars

    Life, Lived: Focus on the personal, intimate experience of being a person in a strange-yet-familiar universe.

    Diversity of Cultures: Each world has its own customs, challenges, social systems, and daily life.

    Choice and Consequence: Every decision, big or small, shapes the character’s journey and the societies they inhabit.

    Replayability: Infinite possible stories—no two lifetimes (or worlds) are the same.

Target Audience

    Fans of life simulators (e.g., BitLife, The Sims, Alter Ego)

    Sci-fi enthusiasts who want to explore new cultures, not just space travel

    Narrative game lovers

    Some mature content included, but without graphic depiction of it

Tone & Style

    Atmospheric and Wonder-filled: A sense of awe, with cozy and hopeful undertones

    Imaginative, Not Grimdark: Sci-fi that’s strange and expansive but ultimately about people

    Evocative Writing: Strong prose and dialogue, inspired by interactive fiction and story games

    Art Style: Minimalist UI with rich, evocative background art and subtle worldbuilding details
